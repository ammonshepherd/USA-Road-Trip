# Notes for creating the booklet

- Create a PDF using your favorite document creator
- The number of pages must be evenly divisible by 4 (a multiple of four).
- Follow the instructions on the github repo to install PyPDF2
  - Download the `print_booklet.py` file (or clone the repo)
  - Run as 
    ```
    python path/to/print_booklet.py path/to/Your-File.pdf
    ```
  - The generated file will be at `path/to/Your-File-IMPOSED.pdf`

# Printing tips

- Printing the PDF from Mac's Preview App: 
  - It's easiest if your printer can print Two-Sided, if so, select that option.
  - For the Orientation, select "Landscape"
  - In the Layout setting, select "Short-Edge Binding"
  - You can test that the settings are correct by printing just the first two pages.
